		<p>The Danish astronomer, Ole Rømer, measured the speed of light in 1675.
			<br/>Note that in this figure the Earth is closest to the planet Jupiter when it is at position <b>E</b><sub>1</sub> in its orbit and Jupiter is at <b>J</b><sub>1</sub>.
		<br/>Six months later the Earth has moved to <b>E</b><sub>2</sub> while Jupiter has moved to <b>J</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
		<p>At <b>E</b><sub>1</sub> the observed interval between eclipses of one of Jupiter's moons (Io) is 42.5 hours.
			<br/>On the basis of this data, Rømer made predictions of the exact times and dates when this moon would enter the shadow of Jupiter (i.e.  would be eclipsed).
			<br/>His predictions for a few days ahead were relatively accurate.
		<br/>However, his predictions became less accurate as the Earth moved towards <b>E</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
		<p>At <b>E</b><sub>2</sub> Rømer found that his prediction based on the interval between eclipses observed at <b>E</b><sub>1</sub> was about 1000 seconds <i>too early</i> (the eclipse happened <i>later</i> than predicted)
		<br/>Or, in other words, the error in his prediction was 1000 sec.</p>
		<p>Rømer then observed that as the Earth continued on its orbit back to <b>E</b><sub>1</sub>, the error diminished until it was practically zero once more when the Earth was back at <b>E</b><sub>1</sub>.</p>
